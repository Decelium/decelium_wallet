# Getting Started
### Install

#### PIP Install

Pip installation installs the [**Decelium wallet**](https://github.com/Decelium/decelium_wallet) as a Python package. This will allow you to use the command-line tool `decw` that lets you create and manage your wallet and deploy websites from the command line. It also allows you to use Decelium wallet modules in your Python programs.

##### Linux

On Linux:

    pip install "git+https://github.com/Decelium/decelium_wallet.git"

##### Windows

On Windows:

If you want to use the `decw` command-line tool, you will need to install using Command Prompt as an administrator (see image). Otherwise you will have to [use the Decelium wallet through Python](./PY_USAGE_EXAMPLES.md). 

    pip install "git+https://github.com/Decelium/decelium_wallet.git"
